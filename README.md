This project is a simple React app that uses Axios to make API GET requests to the Pokemon API. 

It uses React hooks to retrieve the user input for a pokemon name, then uses that name in the API request

PokemonData is a Functional State Component what actually renders the Pokemon information returned from the API that it recieves through props

If the user enters an incorrect Pokemon name, then we display a "No Results" message instead of any Pokemon data

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
